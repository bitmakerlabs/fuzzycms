=== FUZZYCMS

Yet another application built to play with some ideas and some new technologies. Right now, the goal for this project is to create an application that basically functions as a blog, but with the added advantage of allowing people to create their own sites and has the capability of serving up multiple blogs for multiple different organizations (all skinned differently). Okay, basically, it allows people to create their own website/blog with a unique subdomain and what not. Yep, I'm confused now.
